# Cryptolog - Pedagogic Unit for Cryptography

## Introduction

GUI software for basic cryptography and crptanalysis algorithms.
The software is aimed at teenage kids willing to explore the field of cryptology.
It's basically an old project started since high school, but never got the chance to finish it (till now at least).

## Technical details

Version 0.1 beta

## Bugs to fix

Graphical display for different cryptographic algorithms is awful. It still has to be fixed by regrouping different graphical elements.

Ceasar and linear crypto-algorithm are only coded for encryption. Decrypting by only giving the encryption key doesn't work (planned for Cryptanalysis portal).
